            <h3>About Me</h3>

                <p>Hello! My name is Sydney Goodier, I am a first year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I'm in my second semester and am very excited for new classes like web design and pop culture class. I am very excited to try new things and push myself out of my comfort zone with new desgins and ideas.</p>

                <p>I enjoy visual arts very musch, but I also enjoy the preforming arts and have a background in prforming. My favorite preformance was a scene directed by a grade 12. This was <em>"5 Lesbians Eating A Quiche"</em>, where I played <em>Lulie</em>. I also really enjoyed doing a monologue from the play <em>"Enigma"</em>, where I played <em>She</em>. </p>
