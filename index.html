            <h3>About Me</h3>

                <img src="images/goodier-sydney-clown.jpg" alt="sydney goodier as a clown" width="500">

                <p>Hello! My name is Sydney Goodier, I am a first year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I'm in my second semester and am very excited for new classes like web design and pop culture class. I am very excited to try new things and push myself out of my comfort zone with new desgins and ideas.</p>

                <p>I enjoy visual arts very musch, but I also enjoy the preforming arts and have a background in prforming. My favorite preformance was a scene directed by a grade 12. This was <em>"5 Lesbians Eating A Quiche" by Andrew Hobgood and Evan Linder</em>, where I played <em>Lulie</em>. I also really enjoyed doing a monologue from the play <em>"Enigma" by Floyd Dell</em>, where I played <em>She</em>. Down below I will insert the beginning of this beautiful monologue. </p>

            
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Do you remember when we fell in love? No--it happened to me. It didn't happen to you. You made up your mind and walked in, with the air of a god on a holiday. It was I who fell--headlong, dizzy, blind. I didn't want to love you. It was a force too strong for me. It swept me into your arms. I prayed against it. I had to give myself to you, even though I knew you hardly cared. I had to--for my heart was no longer in my own breast. It was in your hands, to do what you liked with. You could have thrown it in the dust. It pleased you not to. You put it in your pocket. </p>
